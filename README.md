# Multiple Sequence Alignment using multi-objective optimization approach

## Requirements for external libraries
- First cell of the MSA.ipynb installs and imports all the library required for the successful execution of the code.

## Input
- This implementation reads the input sequences for the multiple sequence alignment from the "input1.txt" file.
- Input should be in the FASTA format.

## Output
- After successful execution, output will be displayed on the notebook as well as stored in the "output1.txt" file.
- Generated output will be stored in FASTA format.

## Execution
- Open the notebook "MSA.ipynb" and hit "cells -> run all" if you are running from jupyter notebook.
- To run the "MSA.jl" file, run the following command: "julia MSA.jl"
